# Agentic AI Platform 🤖

A **multi-agent AI system** designed to autonomously plan, execute, supervise, and evaluate tasks using AI agents.  
This project demonstrates an **agentic AI pipeline** with Planner → Executor → Supervisor → Critic, all coordinated through a **Gradio web UI**.

---

## Features

- **Planner Agent**: Generates a plan of tasks based on a user-defined goal.  
- **Executor Agent**: Executes tasks and returns results.  
- **Task Supervisor**: Reviews task execution, decides retries, and ensures task reliability.  
- **Critic Agent**: Evaluates completed tasks for correctness and provides feedback/suggestions.  
- **Gradio UI**: Simple, interactive web interface to input goals, view execution logs, and see task summaries.

- The pipeline **loops** until the supervisor decides the plan is complete.  
- Critic provides **quality checks** and recommendations for improving task results.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**  
- **Gradio** for interactive web interface  
- **Transformers / Hugging Face models** for LLM-based agents  
- Modular architecture for **Planner, Executor, Supervisor, Critic** agents
